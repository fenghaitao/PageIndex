Identifiers beginning with an underscore are reserved for the language and standard library.\n\n- **Constant Literals**: DML supports literals for strings, characters, integers (in decimal, hexadecimal, or binary), booleans, and floating-point numbers. Integer literals can include underscores for readability. String and character literals use escape sequences for special characters and byte values.\n\n- **Comments**: DML uses C-style comments, supporting both inline (`/* ... */`) and end-of-line (`// ...`) formats.\n\n- **Module System**: DML modules are source files that can be imported using the `import` directive. Imported files are merged into the main model, similar to C's `#include`, but must be parsable in isolation. Imports are idempotent, and the import hierarchy affects which declarations can be overridden.\n\n- **Source File Structure**: DML source files define device structure and behavior. Device-defining files start with a language version declaration and a device declaration, followed by parameters, methods, data fields, object, or global declarations. Importable files omit the device declaration.\n\n- **Language Version Declaration**: Each DML file should begin with a version declaration (e.g., `dml 1.4;`), which determines the parser and library versions used. All imported files must match the importing file's language version.\n\n- **Device Declaration**: Files with a device declaration define a Simics device class. Only the initial file may contain a device declaration, and it must follow the version declaration.\n\n- **Pragmas**: DML supports compiler directives called pragmas, written as `/*% tag ... %*/`. Pragmas are not part of the language proper and do not affect semantics unless by accident. Their meaning depends on placement, and unrecognized pragmas generate warnings. The document lists that DMLC supports specific pragmas."

Ports can be simple (single pin) or complex (high-level communication interfaces), and can be organized as arrays for modeling multiple connectors. Ports are represented as separate configuration objects with a naming convention in Simics.\n\n- **Subdevices**: Introduced as structural elements representing distinct subsystems within a device, similar to groups, used to organize related banks, ports, and attributes.\n\nOverall, the document explains how these structural elements (groups, ports, subdevices) are used to organize, namespace, and abstract components within device models, with practical examples and conventions for their use and representation."

It also explains the behavior of such calls when performed via values of template type, emphasizing requirements for shared implementations. The document then introduces the \"after\" statement, which schedules method calls to occur at a specified future point, describing its syntax, limitations, and association with objects. It elaborates on two forms of \"after\" statements: \"after delay\" statements, which schedule calls after a time delay, and \"hook-bound after\" statements, which schedule calls to occur upon the next message sent through a specified hook, including how message components are bound to method parameters. Serialization requirements for method arguments in suspended calls and examples of usage are also provided."

The main points covered include:\n\n1. **Standard After Statements**: Explains that arguments to the called method are evaluated and stored at the time the after statement is executed. All input parameters must be serializable, prohibiting use with pointer parameters unless they are message component parameters.\n\n2. **Hook-Bound After Statements**: Details how suspended method calls can be bound to hooks, executing when a message is sent through the hook. Message components can be mapped to method arguments, with syntax for binding and rules for argument usage. Restrictions on serializability and pointer usage are discussed, with examples illustrating valid and invalid usages.\n\n3. **Immediate After Statements**: Describes a form of after statement that schedules method calls to execute as soon as the simulation engine is ready, ensuring device consistency and avoiding ordering bugs. Unlike other forms, arguments do not need to be serializable and pointers can be passed, but stack-allocated pointers are unsafe. Execution order within device instances is FIFO, but not defined across devices.\n\nOverall, the document covers the evaluation, storage, and execution timing of suspended method calls using various forms of after statements, their syntax, argument handling, and constraints, with practical examples and warnings about pointer usage."

The document introduces \"immediate after statements,\" detailing their purpose in ensuring correct ordering and state consistency when scheduling method calls after device operations, and contrasts them with \"after 0 cycles\" statements. It provides a practical example involving a device and a manager, illustrating how immediate after statements can resolve subtle bugs in asynchronous communication by deferring callbacks until the device is in a consistent state.

Templates are categorized by object type (e.g., register, attribute, bank) and by functionality (e.g., reset, logging, access control).\n\n4. **Universal Templates**: Templates applicable to all object kinds, providing parameters for name, description, documentation, limitations, and lifecycle methods (`init`, `post_init`, `destroy`). The `object` template is the base for all objects, exposing references to parent, device, and indices.\n\n5. **Device, Group, Attribute, Connect, Interface, Port, Subdevice, Implement, Bank, Register, Field, and Event Objects**: Each object type is described with its associated templates, parameters, and methods. For example:\n   - **Device objects**: Top-level, with lifecycle methods and configuration parameters.\n   - **Attribute objects**: Methods for getting/setting values, configuration, and persistence.\n   - **Connect objects**: Methods for validating and setting connections.\n   - **Bank objects**: Methods for memory and transaction access, parameters for mapping, overlapping, partial access, and byte order.\n   - **Register and Field objects**: Parameters for value, size, offset, fields, and methods for reading/writing, including handling unmapped bits.\n   - **Event objects**: Templates for time/cycle-based events, with methods for posting, removing, and handling event data.\n\n6. **Standard Templates for Registers and Fields**: Utility templates for common register/field behaviors, such as:\n   - **Reset templates**: Power-on, hard, and soft reset mechanisms, with customizable behavior and suppression options.\n   - **Access control templates**: Read-only, ignore-write, read-zero, and soft-reset value templates, affecting how software and hardware interact with registers and fields.\n\n7. **Usage Notes and Implementation Details**: Guidance on overriding templates, inheritance, and best practices for efficient and flexible device modeling.\n\nOverall, the document provides a comprehensive technical reference for defining, configuring, and customizing device models in DML, focusing on compile-time constructs, object hierarchy, template-based behavior, and standard mechanisms for device lifecycle, access, and reset."

Bank objects inherit both the io_memory and shown_desc templates and provide several key methods for memory and transaction access:\n\n- io_memory_access: Handles memory operations using generic transactions, extracting necessary information and updating the transaction state, with support for passing auxiliary data.\n- transaction_access: Manages accesses based on the transaction interface, handling read, write, get, and set operations, splitting large accesses into smaller chunks, and returning appropriate exception codes.\n- write: Performs write operations at a specified offset, forwarding accesses to registers and handling partial or overlapping register coverage. Unmapped portions of a write trigger the unmapped_write method, which can throw exceptions to signal access failures.\n\nThe document outlines how these methods interact with register objects, including logic for determining register coverage and handling exceptions for invalid accesses."

The default value is 0, and the template provides default initialization behavior for both registers and fields.\n- Event objects are defined using the event template, which itself requires instantiation of one of six predefined event templates (simple_time_event, simple_cycle_event, uint64_time_event, uint64_cycle_event, custom_time_event, custom_cycle_event). These templates provide event-related methods such as event and post.\n- The event template also inherits the shown_desc template for descriptive purposes."

Instantiating them on a register causes read/write operations to treat the register as a single field, ignoring any subfields.\n\n- **Init_val Template**: Extends the init template and provides an `init_val` parameter to define the initial value of a register or field. Overrides are allowed at both the register and field level, with field overrides taking precedence for their covered bits. The template also provides default initialization behavior for registers and fields.\n\n- **Event Objects and Templates**: Event objects require instantiation of one of six predefined event templates, which determine the type of data and timing (seconds or cycles) associated with the event. These templates provide methods for posting, triggering, and managing events, including handling event data, serialization/deserialization for custom events, and memory management for event data.\n\n- **Event Methods**: Common methods include `event` (triggering the event), `post` (posting the event to a queue), and, for certain templates, `remove`, `posted`, and `next` for queue management. Custom event templates also provide methods for saving and restoring event state (`get_event_info`, `set_event_info`) and for cleaning up event data (`destroy`).\n\nOverall, the document outlines mechanisms for customizing register access and initialization, as well as a flexible event system supporting various data types and timing models."

The document details how templates are instantiated for object types (e.g., registers), how behavior templates (like uint64_attr) provide standard implementations, and how interface templates define abstract or overrideable methods (such as init or write). It emphasizes the importance of explicitly instantiating templates to override default behavior and improve efficiency and flexibility. Examples are provided to illustrate template inheritance and overriding. The document also introduces universal templates applicable to all object kinds, including 'name' (for object naming), 'desc' (for short descriptions and docstrings), 'shown_desc' (for user-exposed descriptions), and 'documentation' (for longer descriptions), explaining their parameters and usage in DML."

These resets are implemented via templates (poreset, hreset, sreset) that define corresponding ports and methods (power_on_reset, hard_reset, soft_reset) to restore registers and fields to initial values. The document describes how these methods can be overridden for custom behavior, such as resetting to different values or suppressing resets (using templates like soft_reset_val, sticky, and no_reset).\n\nIt also discusses best practices for modeling power and reset behavior, including recommendations for handling devices with identical hard and power-on resets, devices with multiple soft resets, and accurately simulating powered-off states.

It explains that these templates, accessible via utility.dml, encapsulate common device register functionalities and can be distinguished by their names and log messages, which help developers understand device behavior (e.g., \"undocumented\" vs. \"reserved\" templates). The document clarifies terminology, using \"object\" to refer to both registers and fields, and distinguishes between software and hardware reads/writes. A key section covers templates for reset behavior, outlining three standard reset types\u2014power-on reset, hard reset, and soft reset\u2014and describes how these can be implemented in DML using specific templates (poreset, hreset, sreset) that define corresponding ports and methods to trigger resets. The document emphasizes that DML does not have built-in reset handling but provides these templates to cover common mechanisms."

It highlights critical security risks associated with using pointers to stack-allocated data in immediate 'after' statements and hook 'send' operations, advising safer alternatives. Additionally, it explains the implications of comparing negative constants to unsigned integers, noting that such comparisons always yield a constant result due to DML's handling of signed and unsigned integers."
