It highlights that DML is not a general-purpose programming language but includes algorithmic features similar to ISO C, along with object-oriented constructs for defining and accessing static data structures and automatic bindings to Simics. Key features of DML include syntax for bit-slicing, memory allocation/deallocation operators, error handling mechanisms, built-in logging and assertions, and a metaprogramming facility using templates. The document also discusses the lexical structure of DML, noting differences from C, such as the lack of a requirement to define names before use. It specifies that DML source files use UTF-8 encoding, restricts non-ASCII characters to comments and string literals, and lists reserved words, including those from C, C++, and DML-specific keywords."

          "summary": "The partial document provides an overview of the Device Modeling Language (DML) version 1.4, which is a modeling language designed for writing Simics device models. It highlights the following main points:\n\n1. **Purpose and Features of DML**: DML is not a general-purpose programming language but is tailored for device modeling. It includes object-oriented constructs for defining and accessing static data structures, automatic bindings to Simics, bit-slicing syntax for manipulating bit fields, memory management operators, error handling mechanisms, logging and assertion statements, and a metaprogramming facility using templates.\n\n2. **Lexical Structure**: DML differs from C in that names do not need to be defined before use. It uses UTF-8 encoding, restricts non-ASCII characters to comments and string literals, and reserves specific words from C, C++, and DML itself. Identifiers follow C conventions, with underscores reserved for system use. It supports literals for strings, characters, integers, booleans, and floating-point numbers, with enhanced readability features for integer literals.\n\n3. **Comments**: DML supports both C-style inline and end-of-line comments.\n\n4. **Module System**: DML uses a simple module system where source files can be imported using the `import` directive. Imported files are merged into the main model, with imports being idempotent. The import hierarchy determines the ability to override method or parameter declarations.\n\n5. **Source File Structure**: A DML source file defines both the structure of the modeled device and the actions to be performed during device access."

They can handle messages with associated data types defined during declaration.\n\n2. **Message Handling**: Hooks support two operations:\n   - `send`: Asynchronous message sending, executed after the current call stack is completed.\n   - `send_now`: Synchronous message sending, immediately resuming computations.\n\n3. **Message Component Types**: Hooks can have zero or more message component types, specifying the data format for messages.\n\n4. **Suspended Computations**: The `h.suspended` property provides the count of currently suspended computations on a hook.\n\n5. **Hook References**: Hooks are runtime values, allowing references to be stored, passed, and serialized. Hook references can be compared for equality.\n\n6. **Limitations and Future Plans**: Hooks currently lack configurability, such as error logging for unhandled messages. Future updates plan to address this alongside the introduction of coroutines, which will use hooks for suspension and resumption.\n\n7. **Example Usage**: The document provides examples of hook declarations and methods for handling unhandled messages using wrappers around `send_now`.\n\n"

An example demonstrates its equivalence to creating and posting an event with associated data.\n\n2. **Hook-Bound After Statements**: These statements bind the delayed method call to a specific hook, executing the call when a message is sent through the hook. Message components can be used as arguments, and the document explains the binding syntax and rules for using message component parameters. Examples illustrate valid and invalid usage.\n\n3. **Immediate After Statements**: These statements delay method calls until the simulation engine is ready to progress to the next cycle, ensuring consistent device states and avoiding ordering bugs.

It explains how these resets can be implemented using the `poreset`, `hreset`, and `sreset` templates, which define corresponding ports and methods to trigger resets. The default behavior restores registers to their initial values, but this can be customized or suppressed using specific templates like `soft_reset_val`, `sticky`, or `no_reset`. The document also discusses less common reset scenarios, such as devices with multiple soft reset types or those requiring accurate simulation of powered-off states. It provides two approaches for handling the POWER port: treating it as a pure reset port or as an accurate power supply simulation, depending on the device's requirements."

It defines various components such as `maybe_provisional`, `maybe_device`, `maybe_bitorder`, `device_statements`, and `device_statement`, along with their possible productions. The grammar includes constructs for handling devices, objects, parameters, methods, conditional statements (`toplevel_if` and `toplevel_else`), arrays, and bit ranges. It also specifies optional elements like `maybe_istemplate` and provides rules for nested and conditional device statements. The document appears to be part of a reference manual for DML version 1.4."

      "summary": "The partial document outlines the changes from Device Modeling Language (DML) version 1.2 to version 1.4. It highlights the similarities in syntax and semantics between the two versions while emphasizing key differences. The document includes examples of DML code, such as device definitions, methods, banks, templates, and attributes. It demonstrates managing deprecated language features, porting from DML 1.2 to DML 1.4, and provides examples of method definitions, parameter handling, and memory operations. The focus is on illustrating updates and enhancements in DML 1.4 compared to DML 1.2."
