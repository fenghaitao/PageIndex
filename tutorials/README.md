## Document Search Examples


PageIndex currently enables reasoning-based RAG within a single document by default.
For users who need to search across multiple documents, we provide three best-practice workflows for different scenarios below.

* [**Search by Metadata**:](tutorials/doc-search/metadata) for documents that can be distinguished by metadata.
* [**Search by Semantics**:](tutorials/doc-search/semantics) for documents with different semantic content or cover diverse topics.
* [**Search by Description**:](tutorials/doc-search/description) a lightweight strategy for a small number of documents.
